    "## Style\n",
    "\n",
    "The style of programming that we will be undertaking in this subject is a `notebook` framework. This contrasts with the original style of python, which is more of a `file-based` (or synonymously, `module-based`) framework. \n",
    "\n",
    "The ways these differ is that the `notebook` style:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Uses cells and evaluates them one at a time.\n",
    "2. Produces output below the cell that called for it.\n",
    "3. Is (arguably) more common in scientific computing and data science.\n",
    "\n",
    "In contrast, the `file-based/module-based` style:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Can keep code in multiple files that can then be accessed from one another.\n",
    "2. Produces all outputs to one location.\n",
    "3. Is very common in software engineering environments -- e.g. building apps and running websites. \n",
    "\n",
    "The intent for teaching you some `python` is to:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Allow you to validate your calculations, both as a student and practising engineer/scientist/mathematician.\n",
    "2. Create visualisations to aid exploration, communication and solutions.\n",
    "3. Solve simple problems numerically -- note, numerical methods is a whole (large) field of research.\n",
    "4. Get a taste for a highly useful transferable skill: *programming*."

    "## Nomenclature\n",
    "\n",
    "There are a few words that are intended to do more work when mentioned in a programming context than in their conversational meaning.\n",
    "\n",
    "* `syntax`: The structure of valid statements with respect to the `python` programming language.\n",
    "* `keyword`: a word reserved by `python` for use in the language. These words **cannot** be assigned as variable or functions names. It will cause a syntax error.\n",
    "* `sequences`: An ordered set, i.e. a collection of elements that has a logical order to those elements that it contains.\n",
    "* `brackets`: Refer to square brackets `[` and `]`.\n",
    "* `parantheses`: Refer to parantheses `(` and `)`.\n",
    "* `braces`: Refer to braces `{` and `}`.\n",
    "* `variable`: A name that is assigned a value(s)/object(s). **Cannot** be a keyword.\n",
    "* `function`: A repeatable set of instructions that have been formally written so that they are self contained. Can take multiple inputs and (in python, at least) produce multiple outputs. Best thought of as a 'black box' that when provided with the appropriate inputs it causes an action or returns value(s)/object(s).\n",
    "* `object`: A programming abstraction that groups together 'variables' and 'functions', which are then termed 'attributes' and 'methods', respectively.\n",
    "* `class:` Synonymous with object.\n",
    "* `method`: A function that is tied to an object/class. e.g. `my_object.my_method()`. \n",
    "* `attribute`: A variable that is tied to an object/class. e.g. `my_object.my_attribute`\n"

    "Those with a star/asterisk (`*`) next to their name will be explored in this subject, `classes` will be touched upon too.\n",
    "\n",
    "The basics types in python are:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Numerics:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* `int`* -- An integer. \n",
    "\n",
    ">    *i.e.* a whole number, a number with no fractional part. \n",
    ">    *e.g.* `1, 8, 99, 1000`\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* `float`* -- A floating point number. \n",
    "\n",
    ">    *i.e.* a number with values (even zero values) after the decimal place.\n",
    ">    *e.g.* `2.0, 3.14, 2.71`\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* `complex`* -- Numbers with an imaginary component, indicated by j.\n",
    "\n",
    ">    *e.g.* `2+3j, b+cj, 0.5+0.5j`\n",
    ">   *Note:* The `j` must **follow** the number directly with no other character or operator between them.\n",
    "\n",
    "* `boolean`* and `None`* -- statements that result from logical comparisons and are termed `boolean` after George Boole, who did work on Mathematical Logic.\n",
    "\n",
    ">    *e.g.* `True`, `False` and `None` -- Sometimes `False` just isn't quite right and so a `None` can be used (e.g. in a search, in a matching process or in a set).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Sequences:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* `list`* -- A changeable set of values of any type, enclosed within brackets, separated by commas.\n",
    "\n",
    ">    *e.g.* `[1, 2, 3]`, `['a', 'b', 'c']`, `[1, 3.14, 'Euler', 9j]`\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* `tuple`* --  An immutable (unchangeable) set of values of any type, enclosed within parantheses, separated by commas.\n",
    "\n",
    ">    *e.g.* `(4, 5, 6)`, `('d', 'e', 'f')`, `(9, 2.71, 'Gauss', 1j)`\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* `str`* -- A text string of one or more characters.\n",
    "\n",
    ">    *e.g.* `\"Gauss\", \"Euler\", 'Fourier', 'Laplace', \"e\", 'pi'`\n",
    ">    *Note*: That you can use singe-quotes (`'`) or double-quotes (`\"`) to start and end your string.\n",
    ">    *Aside*: You can also make a multi-line string with tripe double-quotes `\"\"\"\"` or triple single-quotes `'''`.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* `range` -- Used to yield elements of a sequence piecewise. Useful in loops.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Classes:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* `class` -- A way to create and specify the `methods` (class-associated functions) and `attributes` (class-associated variables) of 'objects'.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Others:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* `instances`\n",
    "* `exceptions`\n",
